## Quick Usage Example

This is a quick example of how to get users. Note that you don't need to provide both a list of ids and logins, one or the other will suffice.

```go
client, err := helix.NewClient(&helix.Options{
    ClientID: "your-client-id",
})
if err != nil {
    // handle error
}

resp, err := client.GetUsers(&helix.UsersParams{
    IDs:    []string{"26301881", "18074328"},
    Logins: []string{"summit1g", "lirik"},
})
if err != nil {
    // handle error
}

fmt.Printf("Status code: %d\n", resp.StatusCode)
fmt.Printf("Rate limit: %d\n", resp.GetRateLimit())
fmt.Printf("Rate limit remaining: %d\n", resp.GetRateLimitRemaining())
fmt.Printf("Rate limit reset: %d\n\n", resp.GetRateLimitReset())

for _, user := range resp.Data.Users {
    fmt.Printf("ID: %s Name: %s\n", user.ID, user.DisplayName)
}
```

Output:

```txt
Status code: 200
Rate limit: 30
Rate limit remaining: 29
Rate limit reset: 1517695315
